## üí° Example Customized Prompts

### Example 1: Standalone API Integration

```
I need help migrating and embedding the ADTV Event Automation platform into this project.

CONTEXT:
I have a complete event marketing automation platform (ADTV) in the adtv-migration-package/ folder. I want to integrate it as a standalone service that my main app can call via REST API.

WHAT I NEED:
- Deploy ADTV as separate services on Render
- Call ADTV APIs from my existing Node.js backend
- Display campaign analytics in my React admin dashboard
- Send SMS notifications through ADTV's messaging system

INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Option A: Deploy ADTV separately and integrate via REST API (standalone)

MY CURRENT PROJECT:
- Tech Stack: React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS
- Architecture: Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- Current Features: User management, Product catalog, Order processing
- Deployment: Render (already have backend + frontend deployed)

WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE:
1. Deploy ADTV to Render as separate services
2. Create API client wrapper in my backend to call ADTV
3. Add "Campaigns" menu item in my admin that shows ADTV campaigns
4. Use ADTV's SMS API to send order notifications
5. Share JWT authentication between my platform and ADTV

FIRST QUESTION:
Please read the CURSOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md file in adtv-migration-package/ and help me:
1. Deploy ADTV to Render
2. Create the API client wrapper
3. Set up shared authentication

Let's start with deployment. What environment variables do I need?
```

### Example 2: Monorepo Integration

```
I need help migrating and embedding the ADTV Event Automation platform into this project.

CONTEXT:
I have a monorepo with multiple apps and packages. I want to deeply integrate ADTV so we share database, authentication, and UI components.

WHAT I NEED:
- Merge ADTV into my existing monorepo structure
- Share Prisma database schema between my app and ADTV
- Use same JWT tokens for authentication
- Embed ADTV campaign builder in my main app's UI

INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Option B: Merge ADTV into my existing monorepo (deep integration)

MY CURRENT PROJECT:
- Tech Stack: React, Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS
- Architecture: pnpm monorepo with packages/ and apps/ folders
- Structure:
  - packages/database (shared Prisma schema)
  - packages/auth (shared JWT auth)
  - packages/ui (shared React components)
  - apps/web (main frontend)
  - apps/api (main backend)
- Deployment: Render for all services

WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE:
1. Add adtv-server and adtv-web to my apps/ folder
2. Merge ADTV's Prisma schema with my existing schema
3. Share authentication system (same JWT secret)
4. Import ADTV React components into my main app
5. Deploy everything together as one system

FIRST QUESTION:
Please read the CURSOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md file in adtv-migration-package/ and help me:
1. Understand how to merge the Prisma schemas
2. Set up shared workspace dependencies
3. Migrate ADTV's database models into my existing database

Let's start with the database schema merge. What do I need to do?
```

### Example 3: Module Extraction

```
I need help migrating and embedding the ADTV Event Automation platform into this project.

CONTEXT:
I don't need the full ADTV platform, just the SMS and Email sending features. I want to extract these as reusable modules.

WHAT I NEED:
- Extract SMS provider service (Bonzo/Twilio abstraction)
- Extract Email sending service (SMTP/Gmail)
- Use these in my existing notification system
- Keep it lightweight - no database, no full platform

INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Option C: Extract only specific features I need (module extraction)

MY CURRENT PROJECT:
- Tech Stack: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, MongoDB
- Architecture: Simple Express API with service layer
- Current Features: User notifications (currently basic nodemailer)
- Deployment: Heroku

WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE:
1. Create a messaging/ folder in my src/services/
2. Copy ADTV's SMS provider abstraction
3. Copy ADTV's email service
4. Use them in my existing notification service
5. Configure Bonzo for SMS instead of my current provider

FIRST QUESTION:
Please read the CURSOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md file in adtv-migration-package/ and help me:
1. Identify which files from ADTV I need to copy
2. Understand dependencies I need to install
3. Show me how to configure the services

What files should I copy and what dependencies do I need to add?
```
