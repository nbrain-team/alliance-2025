I need help migrating and embedding the ADTV Event Automation platform into this project.

CONTEXT:
I have a complete, production-ready event marketing automation platform (ADTV) that I want to integrate into this existing project. The ADTV platform includes campaign management, multi-channel messaging (SMS/Email/Voicemail), contact tracking, unified inbox, and analytics.

WHAT I NEED:
Help me integrate ADTV into this project so I can:
1. Use its campaign management features
2. Send SMS/Email/Voicemail through its APIs
3. Track contacts and conversations
4. View analytics and reports

INTEGRATION APPROACH:
[Choose one or tell me which is best:]
- Option A: Deploy ADTV separately and integrate via REST API (standalone)
- Option B: Merge ADTV into my existing monorepo (deep integration)
- Option C: Extract only specific features I need (module extraction)

DOCUMENTATION LOCATION:
All ADTV documentation and source code is in: adtv-migration-package/

KEY FILES TO READ FIRST:
1. adtv-migration-package/CURSOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md - Start here!
2. adtv-migration-package/INTEGRATION_EXAMPLES.md - Code examples
3. adtv-migration-package/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Complete reference

INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOU (CURSOR):
1. Read CURSOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md first - it contains everything you need
2. Ask me which integration approach I prefer (A, B, or C above)
3. Help me understand what changes need to be made to THIS project
4. Guide me step-by-step through the integration
5. Reference the documentation files as needed
6. Show me code examples from INTEGRATION_EXAMPLES.md

MY CURRENT PROJECT:
[REPLACE WITH YOUR PROJECT DETAILS:]
- Tech Stack: React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, etc.
- Architecture: Monorepo / Standalone apps / etc.
- Current Features: What your app currently does
- Deployment: Render / AWS / Vercel / etc.

WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE:
[REPLACE WITH YOUR SPECIFIC GOALS:]
- Example: "Add event campaign creation to my admin dashboard"
- Example: "Use ADTV's SMS sending for my notification system"
- Example: "Embed ADTV's campaign builder in my platform"
- Example: "Share authentication between my platform and ADTV"

FIRST QUESTION:
Based on my project description above, which integration approach (A, B, or C) would you recommend and why?

Then, please read the CURSOR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md file and help me get started.

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

IF YOU WANT: "Deploy separately and call APIs"
USE: Option A (Standalone API integration)
FASTEST: 1-2 hours to integrate

IF YOU WANT: "Merge into my monorepo"
USE: Option B (Monorepo integration)
DEEPEST: 4-8 hours for full integration

IF YOU WANT: "Just the SMS/Email features"
USE: Option C (Module extraction)
LIGHTEST: 1-2 hours to extract modules

MY CURRENT PROJECT:
- Tech Stack: React 18, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Tailwind CSS
- Architecture: Monorepo with pnpm workspaces (packages/ and apps/ folders)
- Current Features: User management, product catalog, order processing
- Deployment: Render (backend web service + frontend static site)

WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE:
- Deploy ADTV as separate Render services
- Call ADTV APIs from my existing backend to create campaigns
- Add "Campaigns" tab in my admin dashboard to display ADTV campaigns
- Use ADTV's SMS API to send order notification texts
- Share JWT authentication so users login once for both platforms

INTEGRATION APPROACH:
Option A - Deploy separately and integrate via REST API (seems easiest for my setup)
